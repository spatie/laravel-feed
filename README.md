This package provides an easy way to generate [rss feeds](http://www.whatisrss.com/). There's almost no coding required on your part.
Just follow the installation instructions and provide some good values for the config file and you're
good to go.

Spatie is a webdesign agency based in Antwerp, Belgium. You'll find an overview of all our open source projects [on our website](https://spatie.be/opensource).

## Postcardware

You're free to use this package (it's [MIT-licensed](LICENSE.md)), but if it makes it to your production environment we appreciate you sending us a postcard from your hometown, mentioning which of our package(s) you are using.

Our address is: Spatie, Samberstraat 69D, 2060 Antwerp, Belgium.

Aa postcards are published [on our website](https://spatie.be/en/opensource/postcards).

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require spatie/laravel-feed
```

Next up, the service provider must be registered:

```php
'providers' => [
    ...
    Spatie\Feed\FeedServiceProvider::class,

];
```

**Important note**: The provider must be registered **after** your application's route service provider (`App\Providers\RouteServiceProvider`)

Then, you must register the routes the feeds will be displayed on using the `feeds`-macro.
It's best to put this macro before registering any other routes.

```php
// in your routes file
Route::feeds();
```

Next, you must publish the config file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Feed\FeedServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

This is the content of the published file laravel-feed.php:

```php
return [

    'feeds' => [
        [
            /*
             * Here you can specify which class and method will return
             * the items that should appear in the feed. For example:
             * '\App\Model@getAllFeedItems' or ['\App\Model@getAllFeedItems', 'filter']
             */
            'items' => '',

            /*
             * The feed will be available on this url.
             */
            'url' => '',

            'title' => 'My feed',

        ],
    ],

];

```

You can pass a string as a first argument of the macro. The string will be used as a prefix for
the value specified in the `url` key of the config file.

Please note that you can register multiple feeds by having multiple items in the `feeds`-key.

Optionally you can publish the view files:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Feed\FeedServiceProvider" --tag="views"
```


### Automatically generate feed links

To discover a feed, feed readers are looking for a tag in the head section of your html documents that looks like this: 


```html
<link rel="alternate" type="application/atom+xml" title="News" href="linkToYourFeed" />
```

You can put that link manually in your template, but this package can also automate that for you.
Just put this include in the head section of your template.
 
```php
 @include('laravel-feed::feed-links')
```

## Usage

Imagine you have a model named `NewsItem` that contains records that you want to have displayed in the feed.

First you must implement the `FeedItem` interface on that model. Here's an example.

``` php
class NewsItem implements FeedItem
{
    public function getFeedItemId()
    {
        return $this->id;
    }

    public function getFeedItemTitle() : string
    {
        return $this->title;
    }

    public function getFeedItemSummary() : string
    {
        return $this->text;
    }

    public function getFeedItemUpdated() : Carbon
    {
        return $this->last_updated;
    }

    public function getFeedItemLink() : string
    {
        return action('NewsItemController@detail', [$this->url]);
    }
    
    public function getFeedItemAuthor() : string
    {
        return $this->author;
    }
}
```

Next, you'll have to create a method that will return all the newsItems that must be displayed in 
the feed. You can name that method anything you like and you can do any query you want.

```php
//in your NewsItem model

public function getFeedItems()
{
   return NewsItem::all();
}
```

And finally you have to put the name of your class and the url where you want the feed to rendered
in the config file:

```php
//app/config/laravel-feed

return [

    'feeds' => [
        [
            /*
             * Here you can specify which class and method will return
             * the items that should appear in the feed. For example:
             * '\App\Model@getAllFeedItems'
             */
            'items' => 'App\NewsItem@getFeedItems',

            /*
             * The feed will be available on this url.
             */
            'url' => '/feed',

            'title' => 'All newsitems on mysite.com',
        ],
    ],

];

```
