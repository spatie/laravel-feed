## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require spatie/laravel-feed
```

Register the routes the feeds will be displayed on using the `feeds`-macro.

```php
// In routes/web.php
Route::feeds();
```

This will register a route `/feed` in your application. If you want to use a different URL, you can pass a string as a first argument of the macro. The string will be used as a URL for your feed.

Next, you must publish the config file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Feed\FeedServiceProvider" --tag="feed-config"
```

Here's what that looks like:

```php
return [
    'feeds' => [
        'main' => [
            /*
             * Here you can specify which class and method will return
             * the items that should appear in the feed. For example:
             * 'App\Model@getAllFeedItems'
             *
             * You can also pass an argument to that method:
             * ['App\Model@getAllFeedItems', 'argument']
             */
            'items' => '',

            /*
             * The feed will be available on this url.
             */
            'url' => '',

            'title' => 'My feed',
            'description' => 'The description of the feed.',
            'language' => 'en-US',

            /*
             * The view that will render the feed.
             */
            'view' => 'feed::feed',
        ],
    ],
];
```

Optionally you can publish the view files:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Feed\FeedServiceProvider" --tag="feed-views"
```

## Usage

Imagine you have a model named `NewsItem` that contains records that you want to have displayed in the feed.

First you must implement the `Feedable` interface on that model. `Feedable` expects one method: `toFeedItem`, which should return a `FeedItem` instance.

```php
// app/NewsItem.php

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Spatie\Feed\Feedable;
use Spatie\Feed\FeedItem;

class NewsItem extends Model implements Feedable
{
    public function toFeedItem(): FeedItem
    {
        return FeedItem::create()
            ->id($this->id)
            ->title($this->title)
            ->summary($this->summary)
            ->updated($this->updated_at)
            ->link($this->link)
            ->author($this->author);
    }
}
```

If you prefer, returning an associative array with the necessary keys will do the trick too.

```php
// app/NewsItem.php

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Spatie\Feed\Feedable;
use Spatie\Feed\FeedItem;

class NewsItem extends Model implements Feedable
{
    public function toFeedItem(): FeedItem
    {
        return FeedItem::create([
            'id' => $this->id,
            'title' => $this->title,
            'summary' => $this->summary,
            'updated' => $this->updated_at,
            'link' => $this->link,
            'author' => $this->author,
        ]);
    }
}
```

Next, you'll have to create a method that will return all the items that must be displayed in 
the feed. You can name that method anything you like and you can do any query you want.

```php
// app/NewsItem.php

public static function getFeedItems()
{
   return NewsItem::all();
}
```

Finally, you have to put the name of your class and the url where you want the feed to rendered
in the config file:

```php
// config/feed.php

return [

    'feeds' => [
        'news' => [
            /*
             * Here you can specify which class and method will return
             * the items that should appear in the feed. For example:
             * '\App\Model@getAllFeedItems'
             */
            'items' => 'App\NewsItem@getFeedItems',

            /*
             * The feed will be available on this url.
             */
            'url' => '/feed',

            'title' => 'All newsitems on mysite.com',

            /*
             * Custom view for the items.
             *
             * Defaults to feed::feed if not present.
             */
            'view' => 'feed::feed',
        ],
    ],

];
```

The `items` key must point to a method that returns one of the following:

- An array or collection of `Feedable`s
- An array or collection of `FeedItem`s
- An array or collection of arrays containing feed item values

### Customizing your feed views

This package provides, out of the box, the `feed::feed` view that displays your feeds details.

However, you could use a custom view per feed by providing a `view` key inside of your feed configuration.

In the following example, we're using the previous `News` feed with a custom `feeds.news` view (located on `resources/views/feeds/news.blade.php`):

```php
// config/feed.php

return [

    'feeds' => [
        'news' => [
            'items' => 'App\NewsItem@getFeedItems',

            'url' => '/feed',

            'title' => 'All newsitems on mysite.com',

            /*
             * Custom view for the items.
             *
             * Defaults to feed::feed if not present.
             */
            'view' => 'feeds.news',
        ],
    ],

];
```

### Automatically generate feed links

To discover a feed, feed readers are looking for a tag in the head section of your html documents that looks like this: 

```html
<link rel="alternate" type="application/atom+xml" title="News" href="/feed">
```

You can add this to your `<head>` through a partial view.
 
```php
 @include('feed::links')
```

As an alternative you can use this blade component:

```html
<x-feed-links />
```
